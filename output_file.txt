 My uncle - high ideals inspire him;
 but when past joking he fell sick,
 he really forced one to admire him --
 and never played a shrewder trick.
 Let others learn from his example!
 But God, how deadly dull to sample
 sickroom attendance night and day
 and never stir a foot away!
 And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
 of entertaining the half-dead:
 one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
 and glumly serves the medicine bottle,
 and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
 "When will the devil come for you?"

 Such were a young rake's meditations --
 by will of Zeus, the high and just,
 the legatee of his relations --
 as horses whirled him through the dust.
 Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
 without preliminary feeler
 let me acquaint you on the nail
 with this the hero of my tale:
 Onegin, my good friend, was littered
 and bred upon the Neva's brink,
 where you were born as well, I think,
 reader, or where you've shone and glittered!
 There once I too strolled back and forth:
 but I'm allergic to the North...

 After a fine career, his father
 had only debts on which to live.
 He gave three balls a year, and rather
 promptly had nothing left to give.
 Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
 at first Madame gave him tuition,
 from her Monsieur took on the child.
 He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
 Monsieur l'Abb&eacute;, the mediocre,
 reluctant to exhaust the boy,
 treated his lessons as a ploy.
 No moralizing from this joker;
 a mild rebuke was his worst mark,
 and then a stroll in Letny Park.
